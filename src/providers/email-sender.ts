/**
 * `EmailSender` — the seam for transmitting outbound mail.
 *
 * See `src/providers/README.md` for the pattern this fits into. This is the
 * `send()` half of specs/mail/sending.md; `src/mail/send.ts` (`sendReply`)
 * is the engine-side orchestration that calls it as step 3 of the
 * persist→send→mark ordering (specs/mail/sending.md §3).
 *
 * ## The `Message-ID` contract is load-bearing
 *
 * Outbound-anchored threading (specs/mail/threading.md §2, specs/mail/sending.md
 * §1) only works if the `Message-ID` a customer's reply eventually echoes
 * back in `In-Reply-To`/`References` is EXACTLY the signed-token id the
 * engine minted (`mintReplyMessageId`, `src/mail/reply-token.ts`) — not a
 * provider-generated substitute. So every `EmailSender` implementation MUST
 * transmit `OutboundEmail.messageId` **verbatim** as the RFC 5322
 * `Message-ID` header, and MUST NOT generate or overwrite it with a
 * provider-assigned id. `inReplyTo` and `references`, when present, are
 * likewise engine-set (specs/mail/sending.md §5: caller-supplied from the
 * inbound message being answered) and must be transmitted as given, not
 * reinterpreted. A provider SDK that cannot set `Message-ID` explicitly
 * (some transactional-email APIs only expose a "reply-to" concept and mint
 * their own `Message-ID` unconditionally) is unusable for Helpthread and
 * must not be adapted to this interface — there is no fallback path that
 * preserves threading correctness.
 *
 * `EmailSendResult.providerMessageId` is a SEPARATE, optional field for the
 * provider's own internal delivery id (e.g. for looking up delivery status
 * or bounce webhooks in that provider's dashboard/API later). It carries no
 * threading authority and is never compared against `messageId` — the two
 * ids serve entirely different purposes and must not be confused.
