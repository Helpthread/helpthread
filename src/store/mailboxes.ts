/**
 * `MailboxStore` — the `mailboxes` (migration 009, `src/db/migrate.ts`) seam:
 * the lookups and lifecycle-status mutations the inbound path needs so far.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. Operations exist today, each added by the ticket
 * that first needed it:
 *
 * - {@link MailboxStore.getMailboxByAddress} (HT-39): resolve a Gmail push
 *   notification's `emailAddress` to a connected mailbox (gmail-push.md §3).
 *   It returns the row regardless of `status` — the same "store returns the
 *   row, caller applies the policy" split `ConversationStore.getConversation`'s
 *   `includeDeleted` option uses — so the webhook handler
 *   (`src/api/gmail-webhook.ts`) is what decides `status !== 'active'` means
 *   "reject," not this store.
 * - {@link MailboxStore.getMailboxById} (HT-41): the same lookup, keyed by
 *   id rather than address — the reconcile handler
 *   (`src/mail/gmail-reconcile.ts`) already has a `mailboxId` (from the
 *   queue job) and must re-check the mailbox's CURRENT status before/while
 *   reconciling (gmail-push.md §3, §5), never trusting the enqueue-time
 *   snapshot. Same "returns the row regardless of status" split as
 *   `getMailboxByAddress`.
 * - {@link MailboxStore.markNeedsReconnect} (HT-38): mark a mailbox
 *   `needs_reconnect` when its OAuth grant turns out revoked/expired
 *   (`src/mail/gmail-oauth.ts`'s `getAccessToken`, on an `invalid_grant`
 *   response). `watch()` renewal (HT-42) needs the SAME transition on a failed
 *   renewal (gmail-push.md §6) and should call this rather than duplicate the
 *   SQL — that shared reuse is why this is a store module, not a raw query
 *   inline.
 * - {@link MailboxStore.markPaused} (HT-41): mark a mailbox `paused` — the
 *   deliberate dogfood response to an expired (404) Gmail history cursor
 *   (gmail-push.md §5): "pause the mailbox and flag it for manual
 *   rebaseline," rather than an automatic full-mailbox resync.
 * - {@link MailboxStore.upsertConnectedMailbox} (HT-40; gmail-connect.md
 *   §4-§5): the connect/consent flow's own write — creates the `mailboxes`
 *   row on a first-ever connect, or reactivates an existing `paused`/
 *   `needs_reconnect` row to `active` on a reconnect. Upsert BY `address`
 *   (migration 009's `UNIQUE` constraint) is what makes a reconnect
 *   idempotent: re-running connect for the same account never collides with
 *   its own prior row.
 * - {@link MailboxStore.listActiveMailboxes} (HT-42): list every `active`
 *   mailbox, ordered by `created_at` — the per-mailbox source the daily
 *   watch-renewal + reconciliation-sweep cron (`../mail/gmail-watch-
 *   maintenance.ts`, gmail-push.md §6) iterates. `paused`/`needs_reconnect`
 *   mailboxes are excluded by the query itself, not filtered by the caller
 *   (unlike `getMailboxByAddress`/`getMailboxById` above): neither needs
 *   `watch()` re-armed (a `paused` mailbox isn't being ingested; a
 *   `needs_reconnect` one has a dead grant `watch()` can't fix) nor a
 *   reconcile job enqueued, for the same reason.
 * - {@link MailboxStore.markDisconnected} (HT-47; specs/mail/gmail-connect.md's
 *   disconnect section): mark a mailbox `disconnected` — the terminal,
 *   operator-initiated state the disconnect admin action puts a mailbox into
 *   (migration 017 widens the `status` CHECK to allow it). Distinct from
 *   `paused`/`needs_reconnect` (both are states the PIPELINE puts a mailbox
 *   into automatically); `disconnected` only ever follows an explicit
 *   operator disconnect (`../mail/gmail-disconnect.ts`), which runs this
 *   alongside deleting the mailbox's `mailbox_oauth_tokens`/
 *   `gmail_watch_state` rows in ONE transaction — same `tx?` pattern as
 *   {@link upsertConnectedMailbox}.
 *
 * A fuller `mailboxes` CRUD surface (beyond the operations above) is still
 * narrower than a general CRUD module — add operations as the ticket that
 * needs them requires.
