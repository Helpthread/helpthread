/**
 * `AgentStore` — persistence for `agents` and `agent_auth_identities`
 * (migration 018, `src/db/migrate.ts`; HT-54, specs/auth/agents-and-auth.md).
 *
 * Follows this codebase's standing store convention: an interface + a
 * `create*Store(db)` factory, raw parameterized SQL over the `Db`/`Queryable`
 * seam (`src/db/client.ts`), expected failures signaled as discriminated
 * result unions rather than thrown exceptions (mirrors
 * `ConversationStore.appendThread`'s `AppendResult`) — a duplicate email or a
 * would-be last-admin removal is an ordinary, anticipated outcome of calling
 * this API, not a bug.
 *
 * ## The last-admin invariant (spec §5) and the advisory lock
 *
 * Under Postgres's default READ COMMITTED isolation, two concurrent
 * mutations that each reduce the active-admin set (demote, disable, or
 * delete an admin) can both observe "there are 2 active admins" in their own
 * snapshot and both proceed, silently dropping the count to zero — a
 * guard predicate ALONE does not close this race (spec §5's own worked
 * example). Every mutation here that CAN reduce the active-admin set
 * therefore runs inside a transaction that takes a
 * {@link AGENTS_ADMIN_ADVISORY_LOCK_KEY} `pg_advisory_xact_lock` FIRST, then
 * re-checks the count under that lock — the same tool `src/db/migrate.ts`
 * already uses for its own cross-instance race, applied here to a
 * cross-request one. {@link createFirstAdmin} shares this SAME lock key
 * (spec §6 says so explicitly: "the same `pg_advisory_xact_lock` the
 * last-admin guard uses") — a distinct key from `migrate.ts`'s own
 * {@link MIGRATION_ADVISORY_LOCK_KEY}-equivalent, since these are unrelated
 * critical sections that must never block each other.
 *
 * `updateAgent`/`deleteAgent` only pay the lock's cost when the mutation
 * actually TOUCHES `role`/`status` (i.e., could conceivably matter) — a
 * plain name/timezone edit never takes it. Once a role/status mutation does
 * take the lock, the guard is evaluated unconditionally inside it (rather
 * than trying to skip the count query for "obviously safe" cases like
 * promoting to admin) — the extra count query is cheap, and a single
 * "always guard once locked" code path is far easier to prove correct than
 * a "guard only on the branches that reduce" one; see each method's comment
 * for the exact condition.
 *
 * ## Mailbox access (HT-54 follow-up; spec §3.4/§6, semantics pinned 2026-07-18)
 *
 * {@link createFirstAdmin} and {@link createAgent} each auto-grant the new
 * Agent every mailbox that exists at creation time, in the SAME transaction
 * as the `agents` insert — spec §3.4: "no Agent is born locked out of the
 * deployment's only inbox," any role, both provisioning paths. This is a
 * plain `INSERT ... SELECT id FROM mailboxes` (no `MailboxStore` dependency
 * needed — one extra statement in the same transaction, not a second store
 * call): zero mailboxes existing means the `SELECT` returns zero rows and
 * the `INSERT` is a harmless no-op, never an error.
 *
 * {@link replaceAgentMailboxAccess}'s `'invalid_mailbox'` outcome mirrors
 * `ConversationStore.setConversationAssignee`'s `isAssigneeFkViolation`
 * pattern (`src/store/conversations.ts`): {@link isMailboxFkViolation} below
 * matches SQLSTATE 23503 (foreign_key_violation) on the
 * `agent_mailbox_access.mailbox_id` FK, translating a bad id in the
 * replacement set to a caller-facing outcome rather than an uncontrolled
 * thrown error.
